Marko is a markdown parser written in pure Python that complies [CommonMark's spec v0.29][spec].
It is designed to be highly extensible, see [Extend Marko](#extend-marko) for details.

Marko requires Python2.7, Python 3.5 or higher.

## Why Marko

Among all implementations of Python's markdown parser, it is a common issue that user can't easily extend it to add his own features. Furthermore, [Python-Markdown][pymd] and [mistune][mistune] don't comply CommonMark's spec. It is a good reason for me to develop a new markdown parser and use it.

Respecting that Marko complies CommonMark's spec at the same time, which is a super complicated spec, Marko's performance will be affected.
A benchmark result shows that Marko is 3 times slower than [Python-Markdown][pymd], but a bit faster than [Commonmark-py][cmpy], much slower than [mistune][mistune]. If performance is a bigger concern to you than spec compliance, you's better choose another parser.

## Use Marko

The installation is very simple:

    $ pip install marko

And to use it:
```python
from marko import Markdown
markdown = Markdown()
print(markdown(text))
```
Marko also provides a simple CLI, for example, to render a document and output to a html file:

    $ cat my_article.md | marko > my_article.html
